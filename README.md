# Rock_Paper_Scissors_JS_Proje
Building the "Rock-Paper-Scissors" game using the skills i've learnt following "The Odin Project" foundations course.
I must say this is a very simple and "well-structured" course, so kudos to the guys that put this together.
For now, we're only going to play this game in the console so we only get to test our javascript logic in the browser console
Look forward to improving this project in the no distant time as i continue with the foundations course

Okay! Revisiting this project to add a bit of UI functionality was both challenging and interesting at the same time. 
Got to practice much of what i learned in the DOM manipulation section. Totally worth the long hours i spent starign at my PC screen like a knobhead cause i got stuck. Moving On to more interesting and challenging lessons.
